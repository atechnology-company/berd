apple intelligence sucks but i still made the first ios app to use apple intelligence + private cloud compute through shortcuts
added gemini fallback because the censoring is insane


todo:
make pcc work through the shortcuts
design the ui to actually look good

current scope:
it generates
it has automatic fallback to gemini or perplexity base web search
grounding through perplexity search
custom prompt support
dictation
